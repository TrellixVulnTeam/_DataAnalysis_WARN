Nice to see the Indian fast bowling looking more hostile than the Australian fast bowling attack. Keep firing it in guys... #INDvAUS,151,1252,18022
It has been a wonderful World Cup hosted in Odisha! This tournament will definitely inspire many young kids to take up Hockey as a sport. All the best to the Netherlands and Belgium teams for the Final today. See you there. #HWC2018 #HumBhiHockey #DilHockeypic.twitter.com/6VCpkwx8oC,84,668,8573

Australia have got a very special spinner in @NathLyon421. He has got terrific variations and uses the pace and bounce from the pitch to extract maximum value. #INDvAUS,132,582,8973
